	<h1>History of Life on Earth</h1>
	<h2>Precambrian Eon</h2>
	(4,056,000,000 years)
	<h3>Life</h3>

	</ul>
	<h3>Climate</h3>
	<p>In the Precambrian Eon, the majority of the earth was lava.</p>
	<h3>Geography</h3>
	<p>
		For most of the Precambrian Eon, there wasn't much geography. The Earth was a mass of flowing lava. At the end,
		however, the supercontinent Rodinia formed.

	<h2>Paleozoic Era</h2>
	<h3>Life</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Plants</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Many modern-day plants formed during the Paleozoic Era.

			<b>Animals</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The first fish formed.

				<li>
					The first sea animals to adapt to land evolved.

			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Climate</h3>
	<p>
		Unlike the Precambrian, the Paleozoic Era was cold and dry. This made it a lot easier for life to thrive.
	</p>
	<h3>Geography</h3>
	<p>
		During the Paleozoic Era, Pangaea forms. Because of the movement of the tectonic plates, several mountain ranges
		come into existence, including the Appalachians and the Alps.
	</p>

	<h2>Mesozoic Era</h2>
	<h3>Life</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Animals</b>
			<ul>
				<li>
					During the Mesozoic Era, dinosaurs ruled the Earth.

        </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Climate</h3>
	<p>During the Mesozoic Era, the earth wass less cold, but still dry.</p>
	<h3>Geography</h3>
	<p>
		During the Mesozoic Era, Pangaea begins to break up. South America and Madagascar separate from Africa.
		At the end of the Mesozoic Era, Australia is still attached to Antarctica, and North America is beginning
		to pull away from Eurasia.
	</p>

	<h2>Cenozoic Era</h2>
	<h3>Life</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Animals</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Horses
					<img src="horses" alt="Horses">

				<li>Sheep

        </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Climate</h3>
	<p>
		The Cenozoic is cold and dry once more, with many ice ages.
	</p>
	<h3>Geography</h3>
	<p>
		During the Cenozoic, the continents have moved to their current placements, and several more mountain ranges
		have formed.
